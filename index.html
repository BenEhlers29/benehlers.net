		<h2>Trailer Wrap for the Emmett Bower Band</h2>
		<time>27 OCT 2017</time>
		<p>These days everyone is looking for 'mobile' design. The Emmett Bower Band came to me looking for the original mobile design, an eye-catching wrap for their 7x16 H&amp;H Trailer from Tom Dinsdale Chevrolet. The finished product looks great rolling down the road or parked in front of your favorite honkey tonk.</p> 
		
		<p>The design includes an updated Emmett Bower Band badge logo that has been given a shiny diamond plate background texture. Extra sharp.</p>

		<p>Special thanks to <a href="www.hhtrailer.com" target="_blank">H&amp;H Trailers</a> for getting me the trailer specs when I could not get to Grand Island to do measurements myself. Also, thanks to <a href="http://www.copycatprinting.com" target="_blank">Copycat Printing of Grand Island</a> for doing a great job on the wrap.</p>

  	<h2>Preschoolers and Brand Identity</h2>
    <time>8 MAY 2017</time>
    <div class="more"></div>
    <p>I recently had the priviledge of speaking to a preschool class made up of 4 and 5 year-olds about the topic of <strong>brand identity</strong> and <strong>logos</strong>. Yes, this is a broad topic, but it was kept pretty basic. The discussion mostly centered around who makes those logos, and why are some of them so much easier to remember then others.</p>
    
     <img src="images/pre_k/presentation.jpg" alt="">
    
    <p>I was slightly concerned that I would not be able to grab their attention; however, I came prepared with a presentation full of products and branding that I hoped would command their attention. The presentation went better than I had expected. These kids were very aware of the branding they see in their world everyday. The designer in me was amazed at how in tune these youngsters are with a wide variety of brand identities. The free thinker in me was alarmed at the idea that we are producing a generation of mind numbed robots that merely respond to oft repeated patterns of colors, shapes, and text.</p>
		
		<p>By the end of the presentation it became clear that kids just interact with advertising in a very "visual" way. They are very adept at matching an image with a brand message, especially if that brand is something they enjoy. I imagine this stems from the picture and word association games used in early learning tools. Some brands, like McDonald's for instance have hit the jackpot, while others, like Burger King have not sustained an iconic image and brand message that motivates children. The takeaway, (obviously) was that simplicity and consistency will always do bettter in the long run.</p>
  	
   	<p>Once the presentation was over, I gave the the kids a sheet of paper full of shapes and had them use crayons to design their own logos. Once they finished, I grabbed a few of them and created vector mock-ups of how their simple ideas could make for impactful brand identities. I was really inspired by how easily the ideas were flowing onto the page, and how excited they were to see their creations transformed into real (fake) logos. The samples below illustrate some of the brands that we created.</p>
